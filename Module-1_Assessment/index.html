      <p>When I started my first year in college, I immediately embraced the challenges that were ahead of me. During the first couple of years of college, I had learned about the history and the architect of computers. I was also introduced to programing, which I thought was fascinating.</p>
      <p>I learned about different programming languages such as Java, R, JavaScript, HTML, and SQL. I was also involved in several student organizations including Student Orientation Leaders, Emerging Leaders Program, as well as Peer Health Educators. These programs helped me gained leadership skills and broadened my view of life.</p>
